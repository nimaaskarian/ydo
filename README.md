# ydo
Yet another to-DO application (or Yaml-DO if you don't like FOSS apps that
start their naming by "yet another"),
heavily inspired by [taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/),
is a fast, frictionless, easy to use, simple and featureful commandline utility to manage tasks.

# what is has compared to taskwarrior
- fast
- human readable file format (yaml) for both config and todos
- no database, easy to sync (using syncthing and what not)
- graph dependencies

# what is has compared to [c3](https://github.com/nimaaskarian) 
- less speed :<
- no built in tui :<
- human readable dependency tree (and a more human readable file format)
- no tie to calcurse
- yaml
- graph instead of tree
- frictionless, and complete cli interface
