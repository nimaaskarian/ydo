# ydo
Yet another to-DO application (or Yaml-DO if you don't like FOSS apps that
start their naming by "yet another"),
heavily inspired by [taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/),
is a fast, frictionless, easy to use, simple and featureful commandline utility to manage tasks.

> this app is under heavy development and will change frequently as for now.
> consult help pages of the build you use

- less speed :<
- no built in tui :<
- human readable dependency tree (and a more human readable file format)
- no tie to calcurse
- yaml
- graph instead of tree
- frictionless, and complete cli interface
